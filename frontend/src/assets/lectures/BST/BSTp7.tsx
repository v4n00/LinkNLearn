		<h1>Balancing a Binary Search Tree</h1>
		<p>A Binary Search Tree (BST) is considered balanced when it is structured in a way that ensures operations such as insertion, deletion, and search can be performed in logarithmic time complexity. An unbalanced BST, where one subtree is significantly deeper than others, can degrade performance, approaching that of a linked list in the worst case.</p>

		<h2>Why is Balance Important?</h2>
		<p>The efficiency of operations in a BST depends largely on the height of the tree. In a balanced BST, the height is kept to a minimum, ensuring that operations remain efficient. An unbalanced tree can result in inefficient operations, which is why mechanisms for maintaining or restoring balance are crucial.</p>

		<h2>Indicators of an Unbalanced BST</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Significantly different heights between the left and right subtrees.</li>
			<li>Long chains of nodes, resembling a linked list.</li>
			<li>Increased time complexity for operations, moving towards O(n) in the worst case.</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>Self-Balancing Trees</h2>
		<p>Self-balancing BSTs, such as AVL trees and Red-Black trees, automatically maintain tree balance through rotations and other operations during insertions and deletions. This self-balancing feature ensures that the tree remains efficient for all operations.</p>

		<h2>AVL Trees</h2>
		<p>AVL trees maintain balance by ensuring that the height difference (balance factor) between the left and right subtrees of any node is no more than one. Rotations are performed to maintain this balance as nodes are added or removed.</p>

		<h2>Red-Black Trees</h2>
		<p>Red-Black trees enforce balance through five properties that relate to node coloring, root properties, and more. These properties guide the rotations and recolorings needed to balance the tree after insertions and deletions.</p>
		<br />
		<p>Balancing a BST is essential for maintaining its performance advantages. Self-balancing trees provide mechanisms to automatically ensure this balance, making them a powerful choice for applications where efficient data manipulation is crucial.</p>
