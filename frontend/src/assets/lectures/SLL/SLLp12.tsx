		<h1>Summary and Recap</h1>
		<p>Congratulations on completing this module on singly linked lists! You've covered a lot of ground, from understanding the basics to exploring advanced operations and real-world applications. Let's take a moment to recap the key points.</p>

		<h2>What We've Learned</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>The structure and components of linked lists, including nodes and pointers.</li>
			<li>The different types of linked lists: singly, doubly, and circular.</li>
			<li>Basic operations such as insertion, deletion, search, and traversal, along with their implementation in C.</li>
			<li>The advantages and disadvantages of using linked lists compared to other data structures.</li>
			<li>Real-world applications of linked lists across various domains.</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>Looking Forward</h2>
		<p>With these concepts and skills, you're well-equipped to tackle more complex data structures and algorithms. Remember, mastery comes with practice, so continue experimenting with linked lists in your projects and challenges.</p>
		<br />
		<p>We encourage you to revisit these lessons whenever you need a refresher or further clarification. The more you work with linked lists, the more intuitive they will become. Happy coding!</p>
