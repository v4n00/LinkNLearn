		<h1>Summary and Recap: Understanding Binary Search Trees</h1>
		<p>Congratulations on completing this journey through Binary Search Trees (BSTs)! BSTs are a powerful and efficient way to organize data for quick retrieval, insertion, and deletion. Let's recap the main points we've covered.</p>

		<h2>Key Concepts Revisited</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<strong>Binary Search Tree Definition:</strong> A BST is a binary tree where each node has up to two children, and for every node, all elements in the left subtree are less than the node, and those in the right subtree are greater.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Operations:</strong> The primary operations of a BST include search, insertion, deletion, and traversal (in-order, pre-order, post-order, level-order), each with its specific use cases and complexities.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Complexity Analysis:</strong> The efficiency of BST operations generally ranges from O(log n) in balanced trees to O(n) in the worst case of unbalanced trees, highlighting the importance of balance for optimal performance.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Self-Balancing Trees:</strong> Techniques and structures like AVL trees and Red-Black trees are designed to maintain BST balance automatically, ensuring operations stay efficient.
			</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>Why BSTs Matter</h2>
		<p>BSTs play a crucial role in computer science and software engineering, offering a balanced mix of efficiency and simplicity for data storage and retrieval operations. They are foundational for understanding more complex data structures and algorithms and are widely applied in database systems, file systems, and more.</p>
