		<h1>Advantages and Disadvantages of Linked Lists</h1>
		<p>Linked lists are a fundamental data structure, offering several benefits over arrays in certain scenarios. However, they also come with drawbacks that are important to consider.</p>

		<h2>Advantages</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<strong>Dynamic Size:</strong> Unlike arrays, linked lists can grow or shrink at runtime, making them more flexible for dynamic data.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Efficient Insertions/Deletions:</strong> Adding or removing elements from a linked list is generally more efficient than doing so with an array, especially for operations at the beginning or in the middle of the list.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>No Memory Waste:</strong> Linked lists allocate memory as needed for each element, reducing unused memory that can occur with pre-allocated arrays.
			</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>Disadvantages</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<strong>Memory Overhead:</strong> Each node in a linked list requires extra memory for storing the pointer to the next node, leading to higher overall memory usage compared to arrays.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Sequential Access:</strong> Linked lists do not allow direct access to the elements by their position, making operations like searching for an element slower than in an array.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Complexity:</strong> Implementing and managing linked lists can be more complex due to pointer usage and the need for careful memory management.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<br />
		<p>By weighing these advantages and disadvantages, you can make more informed choices about when to use linked lists in your projects. They are particularly well-suited for applications where the flexibility of dynamic size and frequent insertions and deletions outweigh the disadvantages of increased memory usage and slower element access times.</p>
