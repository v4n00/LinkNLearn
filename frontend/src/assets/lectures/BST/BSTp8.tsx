		<h1>Complexity Analysis of Binary Search Trees</h1>
		<p>Understanding the time and space complexities of operations on Binary Search Trees (BSTs) is crucial for evaluating their performance and efficiency. The complexities vary depending on the tree's structureâ€”particularly its balance.</p>

		<h2>Time Complexity</h2>
		<p>The time complexity of BST operations such as search, insertion, and deletion can range from O(log n) in the best and average cases to O(n) in the worst case. The best and average cases assume a balanced tree, whereas the worst case corresponds to an unbalanced tree that resembles a linked list.</p>

		<h2>Space Complexity</h2>
		<p>The space complexity of a BST is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. This accounts for the space needed to store the nodes themselves. Additionally, the space needed for recursive calls during operations like search and insertion should be considered, which in the worst case can add up to O(n) due to the call stack.</p>

		<h2>Insertion, Deletion, and Search</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<strong>Best and Average Case:</strong> O(log n) - This assumes that the tree is reasonably balanced, allowing operations to discard half of the remaining subtree at each step.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Worst Case:</strong> O(n) - Occurs in unbalanced trees where the height of the tree is equivalent to the number of nodes, making operations linear in nature.
			</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>Traversal</h2>
		<p>The complexity of traversing a BST is O(n), as every node must be visited. This holds true for all traversal methods (in-order, pre-order, post-order, and level-order). The time taken is proportional to the number of nodes in the tree.</p>

		<p>The efficiency of BST operations highlights the importance of maintaining tree balance. Self-balancing BSTs, such as AVL or Red-Black trees, ensure that operations consistently run in logarithmic time by automatically adjusting the tree structure to maintain balance.</p>
